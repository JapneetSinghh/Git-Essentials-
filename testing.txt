Updating the testing.txt from Gtihub.com
Commiting it 

and then git pull -u origin master 
to have the changes pulled from github to my account 





TESTING CONFLICTS 

Making changes in github repo though guthub.com reposiotry. 

Then I will try to push files from my local computer without pulling this change made. 
I will get error, my push request will be rejected

So I will have to pull the changes first 
git pull origin master
